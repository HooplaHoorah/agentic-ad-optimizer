## Tips for Recording

- **Keep it snappy**: Move quickly through each step but pause to highlight key outputs (plan, creatives, scores, recommendation).
- **Use captions**: If not doing voice-over, add text overlays to explain each step.
- **Show real value**: Emphasize that this isn't just automation—it's an intelligent system that learns and adapts based on results.
